# HolmesSquad - Medsaurus (Proof of concept)
Medsaurus is an unified interface for medical records with an end point service to extract data from EMR of hospitals and with a provision of manual upload by the hospital and the patient to keep all the medical history.

The medical history can be shared by patient to their doctor with ease using a time bound authorization enabling data security and privacy.

This will provide a transition from provider-centred care delivery model to patient-driven care delivery model.

The interface can be used from both web and mobile and in local Indian and many foreign languages.
